> Quantity A: The digit in the hundredths place of w
> Quantity B: The digit in the hundreds place of 4w


The terms "hundreds place" and "hundredths place" refer to two different positions in a number:

Hundreds place: This refers to the third digit to the left of the decimal point. For example, in the number 345.67, the digit in the hundreds place is 3.

Hundredths place: This refers to the second digit to the right of the decimal point. For example, in the number 12.456, the digit in the hundredths place is 5.

In the problem you shared:

Quantity A asks for the digit in the hundredths place of w, which is 26.956. The digit in the hundredths place is 5.

Quantity B asks for the digit in the hundreds place of 4w. First, calculate 4w: $ 4 \times 26.956 = 107.824 $ , so the digit in the hundreds place is 1.

Hence, the difference is that "hundreds place" refers to a whole number place, while "hundredths place" refers to a decimal place.
